The first milestone was pretty simple for me because we just followed a tutorial. The difficult aspect was trying to
completely comprehend what I was writing on the script. There were aspects I did not understand because I do not know
all of the operations available in unity, so being introduced to new methods while trying to create a game is a bit 
overwhelming. Also, I did not have the library for unity installed onto my VisualStudio, so everything I was putting in
could not autofill or show me what it did. That made it very difficult to write the script with the tutorial because I 
had to continuously pause to make sure I was writing it correctly.

Another difficulty I faced was the scaling of the canvaas on the tutorial compared to mine. His scaling was fairly large
where mine was a lot smaller. The tutorial scaled the cards around 120, 177; however, my scaling for the cards needed to
be 50, 70. Also, there was a glitch in placing the cards from the player area to the middle area. To fix this, instead of 
making the middle area collider the same size, like he does in the tutorial, I made it cover everything that was not the
player or opponent area. This fixed the problem, but I feel like there is a better way to do this.

Other than these difficulties, and the overall time it took, I found this tutorial to be enjoyable. I liked that I could
choose the colors and placement of the cards and background. This tutorial makes me excited to start creating the 
BlackJack game for Milestone 2.
